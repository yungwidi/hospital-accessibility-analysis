# hospital-accessibility-analysis
A final project (MTH 4322) analyzing hospital accessibility in urban environments using graph theory, shortest path algorithms, and spatial heatmaps.

This project analyzes the accessibility of hospitals in an urban environment using graph theory and shortest-path algorithms. The goal is to evaluate how easily residents of a city can reach medical facilities, using a metric we define as **hospitalizationability**.

## Overview

- Retrieve and model a city's road network as a graph.
- Identify hospital nodes and compute the shortest paths from all other nodes.
- Create a heatmap to visualize accessibility across the city.
- Propose a quantitative metric for evaluating healthcare access.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- NetworkX
- NumPy
- GeoPandas
- Matplotlib
- OSMnx
